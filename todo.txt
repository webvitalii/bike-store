Build a simple web application for a bike store owner to manage his inventory.

Minimum functionality.
- Ability to Create, Read, Update, Delete bikes
- View a list of bikes
- Display bike properties: description, rating, price, qty, type, etc. (a photo for bonus points)
- Connect to and display any API (your choice). Example: Display weather

Feel free to use any technologies that you see fit (in addition to Angular).

Bonus points will be given for styling, user experience, data access work.

Push the finished project into a git repository and send us the link to the repo. 
Put any installation/setup instructions in a README.md file. Also, publish the project and send a link to the hosted site.

Since we'll be working remotely, a brief screen recorded video walkthrough of this project will be helpful.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We look forward to seeing what you come up with.

Hi Noah,

I created the Angular website as per requirements.

Demo URL:
https://app-bike-store.web.app/
OR
https://app-bike-store.firebaseapp.com/

Github with the code:
https://github.com/webvitalii/bike-store


To login and explore the Angular admin panel you can use these credentials:
email: demo@demo.com
password: d3m0p@ssw0rd

I was not able to find a free Weather API so I added the section "Online users" in the sidebar homepage with API call to 3rd party service.

The screen recording is stored here:

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Vitalii
