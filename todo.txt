Build a simple web application for a bike store owner to manage his inventory.

Minimum functionality.
- Ability to Create, Read, Update, Delete bikes
- View a list of bikes
- Display bike properties: description, rating, price, qty, type, etc. (a photo for bonus points)
- Connect to and display any API (your choice). Example: Display weather

Feel free to use any technologies that you see fit (in addition to Angular).

Bonus points will be given for styling, user experience, data access work.

Push the finished project into a git repository and send us the link to the repo. Put any installation/setup instructions in a README.md file. Also, publish the project and send a link to the hosted site.

Since we'll be working remotely, a brief screen recorded video walkthrough of this project will be helpful.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We look forward to seeing what you come up with.
